# Releasing Updates

This plugin has version number set in 3 distinct places in 2 files:

- the plugin header info (wp-plugin-web/wp-plugin-web.php line 14) - this is used in the plugin php code.
- the constant WEB_PLUGIN_VERSION (wp-plugin-web/wp-plugin-web.php line 34) - this is used by
  WordPress.
- in the package.json version value (wp-plugin-web/package.json line 5) this is used by the build step to place
  the release files within a matching version directory for convenient cache busting. All 3 instances need to be
  incremented in conjuction with new releases via github tagging.
  (In a perfect world, we have a runner increment and/or validate this)
